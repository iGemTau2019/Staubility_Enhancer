# Staubility_Enhancer
Welcome to the Staubility Enhancer! We hope that using our product, you will be able to easily design synthetic sequences with higher stability and expression level.  A key challenge in the field of synthetic biology is genomic instability of introduced genes. Once a gene is inserted into a host organism, it can cause an additional metabolic load, significantly reducing host's fitness. Mutations that damage the introduced gene are therefore likely to be selected for, diminishing its expression. These mutations could render synthetic-biology products obsolete and require constant maintenance. 
We propose interlocking a target gene to the N-terminus of an essential gene in the host’s genome, under the same promoter. This way, mutations on the target gene are likely to affect the expression of the essential gene, leading to the mutated host's mortality. 
We are developing a software called the sTAUbility Enhancer, presented here. Given a target gene, it will provide you with the best-fitting conjugated gene candidates. After you select the gene and supply your construct’s purpose, the software will provide you with the best linker candidates. After selection of a linker, the software will scan the construct for mutational and epigenetic hotspots. Using these sites, it will optimize the combined construct for efficient gene expression and increased stability.
