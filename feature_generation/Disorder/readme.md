Input: 'yeast_REAL.zip'. This file contains more than 5500 files, each file is prediction result of one gene. In each file there is per-residue prediction results from disorder prediction algorithms and ANCHOR disordered binding sites. We uploaded one file for example due to copyrights.

Code: The data has been proceeded with MATLAB 'disorder.m' script.
In the code we computed the following features :
1.	Gene_name- the gene's name taken from the file's name.
2.	Mean_score- mean on all the numerical columns in the original file on all the positions (column 3,4,6,12 in the original file).
3.	 Disorder_percentage1- for every gene this score is calculated using all the gene's positions by consensus approach #1. We counted the number of disorder sites in the gene (3/4 in column 7 in the original file) and divided by the number of positions.
4.	Disorder_percentage2- for every gene this score is calculated using all the gene's positions by consensus approach #2. We counted the number of disorder sites in the gene ("DISORDERED" in column 8 in the original file) and divided by the number of positions.
5.	Disorder_percentage_both_algorithms- for every gene this score is calculated using all the gene's positions. We counted the number of disorder sites in the gene when both consensus approaches determined the site as disordered ("DISORDERED" in column 8  and 3/4 value in column 7 in the original file) and divided by the number of positions.
6.	anchor_disorder_percentage- for every gene this score is calculated using all the gene's positions. We counted the number of disorder sites in the gene (1 in column 13 in the original file) and divided by the number of positions.
7.	Anchor_percentage-. We used mean function on all the gene's positions in column 12 in the original file (Anchor score).
8.	IUPRED_percentage- We used mean function on all the gene's positions in column 3 in the original file (IUPRED score).
9.	VSL2B_percentage- We used mean function on all the gene's positions in column 4 in the original file (VSL2B score).
10.	DisEMBL_percentage- for every gene this score is calculated using all the gene's positions. We counted the number of disorder sites in the gene ("DISORDERED" in column 5 in the original file) and divided by the number of positions.
11.	MoreRONN_percentage- We used mean function on all the gene's positions in column 6 in the original file (MoreRONN score).
12.	disorder30_percentage-- for every gene this score is calculated using all the gene's positions. We counted the number of disorder30 sites in the gene ("DIS_30" in column 9 in the original file) and divided by the number of positions.
13.	disorder_percentage1_window1-disorder_percentage1_window30- each window contains 50 gene's positions and the starting point for each window is the number of the window. For example, window 17 is from position 17 until position 66. In each window we counted the number for disorders according to consensus #1 and divided by 50. If the gene's length is smaller than 79 than some windows aren't full and therefore these window's value will be NaN.
14.	 disorder_std1_window1-disorder_std1_window30-in each window detailed in 13, we calculated the standard deviation (If not possible due to incomplete window the value assigned is NaN).
15.	disorder_percentage2_window1-disorder_percentage2_window30- same as described in 13 using consensus #2 (If not possible due to incomplete window the value assigned is NaN).
16.	disorder_std2_window1-disorder_std2_window30- same as described in 14 using consensus #2 (If not possible due to incomplete window the value assigned is NaN).
17.	disorder30_percentage_window1- disorder30_percentage_window30- the windows are same as described before. In each window we counted the number of "DIS_30" values and divided by 50 If not possible due to incomplete window the value assigned is NaN).
18.	disorder30_std_window1- disorder30_std_window30- we created a vector of 0 and 1 when 1="DIS_30" and 0="ORD_30" and for each window and calculated the vector's std (If not possible due to incomplete window the value assigned is NaN).
19.	disorder_anchor_percentage_window1- disorder_anchor_percentage_window30- the windows are same as describe before. The calculation is same as described 6 but for every window (If not possible due to incomplete window the value assigned is NaN).
20.	disorder_anchor_std_window1- disorder_anchor_std_window30- the anchor's values are 0/1, therefore std was easily computed for every window (if not possible due to incomplete window the value assigned is NaN).
21.	max_disorder_percentage_window1- max_disorder_percentage_window30- for every window the value is the maximum score between all the positions and all the score columns in the original file (3,4,6,12) (if not possible due to incomplete window the value assigned is NaN).
22.	disorder_percentage1_lastwindow, disorder_std1_lastwindow, disorder_percentage2_lastwindow, disorder_std2_lastwindow,  disorder30_percentage_lastwindow,disorder30_std_lastwindow, disorder_anchor_percentage_lastwindow, disorder_anchor_std_lastwindow, max_disorder_percentage_lastwindow-  the following were calculate the same way described in 13-21 but the window was different. Here the features were calculated only to the last window- 50 positions from the end and backward and therefore there aren't NaN values.
***If the gene's length is smaller than 129 the last window share's some of its positions with the first 30 windows.
