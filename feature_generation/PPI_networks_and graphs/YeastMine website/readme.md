Files (Input+Output):  The data was downloaded from YeastMine website> Lists> ALL_Verified_Uncharacterized_Dubious_ORFs->Interactions
It contains 5000 rows that depict how many interactions each yeast's protein is involved in. 
The data contains 3 columns – 
•	BioEntity.secondaryIdentifier gives information about the protein's name.
•	BioEntity.name describes the protein's role. Some of the rows in this column have the value – none.
•	Interactions- a numeric column that tells how many interactions a protein is involved in.
Features: We used the data to create a feature that depicts in how many interactions does a protein participate. No code was used.
