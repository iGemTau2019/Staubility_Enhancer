As part of the Characterization Of Genes project we included the all the features from the Ten Genes project (in which we focused only on essential genes) 
on all 6,000 genes in the S. cerevisiae, except for a few individual features like dn / ds and CAI as they had many missing values. 
We recalculated the CAI feature values for all the genes, and instead of the dn / ds feature we created a number of evolutionary conservation features
because we know this type of feature is important for our predictor.
