We created features that could have a connection to the gene&#39;s stability or expression level
using a variety of data sources (academic publications, empiric measurements, etc.).

In order to derive meaningful predictions from our model, we generated many descriptive features for the genes within the host genome, each with a potential connection to the gene's stability or expression level. For this purpose, we used a large variety of data sources (academic publications, empiric measurements, etc.).

The models, data and code for generation of these features are presented within this directory.

Many features used the file "orf_coding_all.fasta.gz" that contains the names and sequences of all the ORFs in yeast (from SGD website). This file appears in this folder.
