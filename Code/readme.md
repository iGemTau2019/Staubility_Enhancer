Staubility Enhacer Code
-----------------------
This folder contains the source code of our product the Staubility Enhacer.

Our code combines many frameworks, some of whom only work on certain operating systems, and some of whom require highly nontrivial installations and dependencies. Thus, running our code as a script is extremely tricky. This is part of the reason we built the GUI framework, to avoid having our users go through this process, and complied it into a softawre.exe, so our users can run it without creating and instaling the differnet dependecies.

Our software.exe was compiled from the code in this folder which is specifeid in the next section.
